 - Update to 1.21.5, as always may have some bugs / things i missed
 - reveal_new_recipes function now gives locked chest recipes
 - Locked chests can now be locked with all types of pottery sherds
 - Cooked blast furnaces can be eaten very very slowly
 - Various other formatting fixes maybe? I normally hate vague changelog entries like this but I wasn't paying a lot of attention, it was really just me reformatting some json in item names to make them display correctly I think

0.2.9 to 0.2.9a (03/19/2025):
 - Added a new test dimension, accessible via /function vvsst:warp/test_dim
 -- Consists of a superflat void world with a layer of barriers
 - New macro function clean, similar to collect function but simply kills all item entities of specified type
 -- Example: /function vvsst:clean {item:dirt}

v0.2.8 to 0.2.8a (03/14/2025):
 - Empty chests in woodland mansions now contain items
 -- Storage rooms (1x2_a9 and 2x2_a2) have a new loot table for the chests

 - Bows and crossbows can take looting
