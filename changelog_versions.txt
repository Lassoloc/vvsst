== VVSST changelog between versions ==
For more details, read the changelog as compared to unmodified vanilla.

v0.4.0 (07/01/2025):
[Gameplay]
 - Updated to 1.21.7, dropped support for 1.21.5
 - Made ocean monuments much rarer (spacing/separation 72/24 rather than 32/5)
 - Smooth quartz, quartz pillars, quartz bricks, and chiseled quartz can now be unpacked
 - Added recipe to craft chests directly from logs
 - Changed chain recipe output quantity to 3
 - Added shears to trial chamber supply chests
 - Added ender pearls to ominous trial vault common rewards
 - Adjusted how blazes drop nuggets again
 -- The quantity is now higher but is no longer guaranteed, the chance going up with Looting
 -- Nuggets are now only dropped on player kills
 - Iron golems drop much less iron when killed by fire damage sources
 -- This is any damage type that Fire Resistance provides immunity to: fire blocks, lava, campfires, magma blocks, burning, and direct hits from fire charges
 -- They will instead drop a new useless "charred dross" item in place of the ingots. Each dross item has a 2/9 chance to be an ingot instead, but only up to a max of 1 (test?)
 - Added rare phantom membranes to fishing junk loot table, slightly reducing the weight of bowls to compensate
 - Added 1-8 prismarine shards to fishing junk loot table when fishing in any biome that is considered an ocean
 - Replaced saddles in fishing treasure loot table with coast armor trim smithing templates
 - Added Astral Barrier enchantment for armor
 - Evokers now have a 25% chance to drop an Astral Barrier book, otherwise dropping any random enchanted book
 - Chests can now be locked with any music disc and both types of trial keys
 - Locked chests now contain the item that was used to lock them
 - Slightly adjusted 1x2_a7 chest contents (replaced one mushroom of each type with coarse dirt)
 - Filled most empty containers in villages (loot tables for the barrels, set items for other containers)
[Technical]
 - Partially added a new set of functions to form an "about this world" command
 -- /function vvsst:about/set_info_text
 --- Requires two macro keys: cat (a value from 1-12) and text (a string)
 --- Example: /function vvsst:about/set_info_text {cat:4,text:"This world uses Nullscape for terrain generation in the End"}
 -- /function vvsst:about/get_info_text
 --- Prints all info text set to your chat (client-side, not server-side)
 -- /function vvsst:about/refresh_gamerule_storage
 --- Writes all gamerule values to storage, with the exception of minecartMaxSpeed
 --- Runs automatically on reload
 -- /function vvsst:about/print_gamerule_values
 --- Unfinished, prints all gamerule values from storage to your chat (note that the current formatting is nearly unintelligible)
