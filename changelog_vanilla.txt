New advancements:
 - Thalassophobia: Kill three elder guardians

Changed entity loot tables:
 - Creepers will always drop a random leaves block when killed by a player
 - Blazes have a chance to drop a handful of iron nuggets when killed by a player
 - Husks can drop sand
 - Piglin brutes will drop a gold block if killed by a player
 - Removed sniffer drops have been readded (moss blocks)
 - Removed goat drops have been readded (mutton)

 - Evokers will additionally drop an enchanted book on death
 -- 75% chance to be a random book and 25% chance to be Astral Barrier (see above)
 - Iron golems will drop useless dross instead of iron ingots when killed by fire, though a single ingot may be recovered

Changed block loot tables:
 - Budding amethyst drops a bunch of amethyst shards
 - Dirt paths and farmland can be silk touched

Changed container loot tables:
 - Mineshaft minecarts contain raw ore instead of ingots, and can contain copper
 - Arrows in jungle temple dispensers can be poison tipped
 - Woodland mansion chests now contain various dark oak items, and can contain diamonds and emeralds
 - The various empty chests found in woodland mansions have been filled with a new loot table for the storage rooms and a handful of mushrooms for the mushroom farm room
 -- Note: the mushroom farm room uses fixed chest contents rather than a loot table
 - Barrels, furnaces, blast furnaces, smokers, brewing stands, and lecterns in villages now contain items rather than being completely empty
 -- Note: All containers except chests and barrels use fixed container contents as the other container types don't support loot tables
 -- A handful of these containers are intentionally left empty, primarily lecterns and brewing stands
 - Shipwreck map chests can contain spyglasses
 - Ruined portal chests can contain nether bricks (the item, not the block)
 - Cold seafloor archaeology can have a trident extremely rarely
 - Ancient city chests have much higher level enchanted books, large quantities of chiseled deepslate, unique potions of haste, and highly enchanted shears
 -- As a side effect of the method used for the enchanted shears, any shears obtained from an ancient city chest and disenchanted at a grindstone will be allowed to be reenchanted in an enchantment table (enchantability stat of 1), unlike normal shears
 - Trial chamber supply chests have shears added to the loot table, with a low chance of being enchanted with Efficiency
 - Tridents in trial vaults are replaced with enchanted books containing the new Penetrating enchantment at a random level
 - Ominous trial vaults can give ender pearls as a common reward

Changed gameplay loot tables:
 - Phantom membranes have been added as very rare fishing junk, with bowls being made slightly rarer to compensate
 - Fishing in any type of ocean biome can give prismarine shards as junk loot
 - Saddles in fishing treasure have been replaced with coast armor trim templates
 -- This may be replaced with a custom armor trim later

Changed structures:
 - Ocean monuments are now much rarer

New structures:
 - Small mushroom huts can generate in mushroom biomes
 -- They're the rarity of igloos or witch huts, and come in red and brown varieties. They have a chest too!
 - Ziggurat temples can generate in mangrove swamps
 -- They contain chests and pots, but have a trap like the other temples
 -- Generation might need some terrain adaptation, and loot tables could use some work
 - Small void hideouts can generate in the gaps between outer end islands
 -- They come in four possible layouts, containing chests and a shulker box or endermite spawner
 -- Loot tables could also use some work, and some layouts may need to be adjusted
 - Secret structure :)
 -- Loot table is currently a placeholder item

Silly changes:
 - A blast furnace in a blast furnace makes a blast furnace
 -- You can try to eat it but I think it might take a while
 - A netherite ingot can be crafted into a single gray dye
 - Cat morning gifts have a small chance to contain eyes of ender (because you had a good Dream)

Known bugs:
 - The Mechanized Building Arm is considered a golden pickaxe under the hood. This means that crafting it increments the stat for golden pickaxes crafted, and it is treated like a golden pickaxe for smelting and repairing purposes
 - Haste potions may sometimes fail to apply components and generate as plain water bottles

Work in progress / planned changes:
 - Small prismarine spikes feature should be added to deep ocean floors
 - Most new recipes need to be sorted into categories and groups
 - Empty containers in structures should have barebones loot tables (partially done with woodland mansions)
 - Infested stone should drop gravel
 - New enchantment Infernal Marauder: mobs drop bonus experience while the player is on fire
 -- As of 24w36a this is not currently possible the straightforward way and a workaround may need to be found
 - New enchantment Spirit Infusion: applied to horse armor, temporarily grants massive buffs to the rider if the horse dies
 - Shulker armor?

Removed changes that may eventually be reconsidered:
 - Pink petals made replaceable
 -- This was removed to fix a bug, but seemingly didn't work anyways
 - Chiseled bookshelves also provided benefit to enchantment tables
 -- Removed due to cheaper recipe compared to regular bookshelves
 - One set of twelve end portal frames could be crafted with the dragon egg
 - Spawners were obtainable in survival:
 -- Pig spawn eggs could be made with a heavy cost (netherite) and crafted into pig spawners
 -- Any spawners findable in normal survival could have their spawn eggs made using a totem of undying
 -- A few other spawn eggs could be dropped from vexes: drowned, endermen, and guardians
 - Offhand attribute charms:
 -- One granted bonus attack damage and attack speed
 -- One granted max health and armor toughness
 -- One boosted speed and was supposed to boost jump height as well
 - Readded pre-1.8 enchanted golden apple recipe
 - Crying obsidian could be made with obsidian and lapis lazuli
 - Smooth quartz blocks could be smelted/blasted a second time to extract trace amounts of iron and generate a relatively high amount of experience
 - Cave spiders could rarely drop Disk 11
 - Endermites could drop popped chorus fruit
 - Ocelots could drop jungle leaves
 - Bats could drop flint
 - Silverfish could drop gravel, and rarely an emerald
 - A number of chest loot tables had been given rare, unfinished items (these were only obtainable as non-functional placeholder items):
 -- desert temple chests, desert temple archaeology, desert well archaeology, vault reward unique (replacing trident), end city treasure, bastion other, nether fortress, pillager outpost, and jungle temple chest
 - Unfinished, unobtainable emerald pickaxe item that had illegal levels of Fortune
