New advancements:
 - Thalassophobia: Kill three elder guardians

Changed entity loot tables:
 - Creepers will always drop a random leaves block when killed by a player
 - Bats can drop flint
 - Blazes also drop a handful of iron nuggets
 - Cave spiders can rarely drop Disk 11
 - Endermites can drop popped chorus fruit
 - Husks can drop paper or sand
 - Ocelots can drop jungle leaves
 - Piglin brutes will drop a gold block if killed by a player
 - Silverfish can drop gravel, and rarely an emerald
 - Removed sniffer drops have been readded (moss blocks)
 - Removed goat drops have been readded (mutton)
 - Wardens will drop echo shards if killed with looting, and a warden head if killed by a player

Changed block loot tables:
 - Budding amethyst drops a bunch of amethyst shards
 - Dirt paths and farmland can be silk touched

Changed container loot tables:
 - Mineshaft minecarts contain raw ore instead of ingots, and can contain copper
 - Arrows in jungle temple dispensers can be poison tipped
 - Woodland mansion chests now contain various dark oak items, and can contain diamonds and emeralds
 - The various empty chests found in woodland mansions have been filled with a new loot table for the storage rooms and a handful of mushrooms for the mushroom farm room
 - Shipwreck map chests can contain spyglasses
 - Ruined portal chests can contain nether bricks (the item, not the block)
 - Cold seafloor archaeology can have a trident extremely rarely
 - The following loot tables have been given extremely rare, unfinished weapons: desert temple chests, desert temple archaeology, desert well archaeology, vault reward unique (replacing trident), end city treasure, bastion other, nether fortress, pillager outpost, and jungle temple chest
 -- Most of these items are not currently functional and all of them are WIP
 -- See work in progress changes for more
 - Ancient city chests have much higher level enchanted books, large quantities of chiseled deepslate, unique potions of haste, and highly enchanted shears
 -- As a side effect of the method used for the enchanted shears, any shears obtained from an ancient city chest and disenchanted at a grindstone will be allowed to be reenchanted in an enchantment table (enchantability stat of 1), unlike normal shears

New structures:
 - Small mushroom huts can generate in mushroom biomes
 -- They're the rarity of igloos or witch huts, and come in red and brown varieties. They have a chest too!
 - Ziggurat temples can generate in mangrove swamps
 -- They contain chests and pots, but have a trap like the other temples
 -- Generation might need some terrain adaptation, and loot tables could use some work
 - Small void hideouts can generate in the gaps between outer end islands
 -- They come in four possible layouts, containing chests and a shulker box or endermite spawner
 -- Loot tables could also use some work, and some layouts may need to be adjusted
 - Secret structure :)
 -- Loot table is currently a placeholder item

Silly changes:
 - A blast furnace in a blast furnace makes a blast furnace
 -- You can try to eat it but I think it might take a while
 - A netherite ingot can be crafted into a single gray dye
 - Cat morning gifts have a small chance to contain eyes of ender (because you had a good Dream)

Known bugs:
 - The Mechanized Building Arm is considered a golden pickaxe under the hood. This means that crafting it increments the stat for golden pickaxes crafted, and it is treated like a golden pickaxe for smelting and repairing purposes
 - Haste potions may sometimes fail to apply components and generate as plain water bottles

Work in progress changes:
 - Small prismarine spikes feature should be added to deep ocean floors
 - Most new recipes need to be sorted into categories and groups
 - Empty containers in structures should have barebones loot tables (partially done with woodland mansions)
 - Infested stone should drop gravel
 - Rare weapon drops need to be finished. Only the pride of the piglins crossbow is currently functional
 - Unobtainable emerald pickaxe item that may be added to loot tables once finished
 - New enchantment Infernal Marauder: mobs drop bonus experience while the player is on fire
 -- As of 24w36a this is not currently possible the straightforward way and a workaround may need to be found
 - New enchantment Spirit Infusion: applied to horse armor, temporarily grants massive buffs to the rider if the horse dies

Removed changes that may eventually be reconsidered:
 - Pink petals made replaceable
 -- This was removed to fix a bug, but seemingly didn't work anyways
 - Chiseled bookshelves also provided benefit to enchantment tables
 -- Removed due to cheaper recipe compared to regular bookshelves
 - One set of twelve end portal frames could be crafted with the dragon egg
 - Spawners were obtainable in survival:
 -- Pig spawn eggs could be made with a heavy cost and crafted into pig spawners
 -- Any spawners findable in normal survival could have their spawn eggs made using a totem of undying
 -- A few other spawn eggs could be dropped from vexes: drowned, endermen, and guardians
 - Offhand attribute charms:
 -- One granted bonus attack damage and attack speed
 -- One granted max health and armor toughness
 -- One boosted speed and was supposed to boost jump height as well
 - Readded pre-1.8 enchanted golden apple recipe
